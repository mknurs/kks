## Abstract

Tafuri at his most "operaist" – the Contropiano years – undertook a critique of architectural ideology and intelectual labour in the era of commodity production testing Tronti's thesis of the social factory. Architectural reading usually ignores Architecture and Utopia's theoretical lineage from earlier Marxist critiques of intelectual mediation of capitalism's contradictions and its grounding in the analysis of material relations of production. In this way the general situation for a Tafurian critique was always unfavourable. And when a contextualization of the operaist thesis is emphasised, it historicizes Tafuri’s essays in a way as to ultimately delegate them to an already past Fordist composition of capital. What we propose in this essay is a realignment of the minimal Tafurian programme, an elaboration of the invariant kernel of a Marxist critique of architectural ideology appropriate for the always unfavourable situation. This undertaking must include a new thesis of the social factory – an analysis of the thread of time since the long cycle (1974 – 2008) and an analysis of the post-Fordist generalization of production relations. Upholding the Tafurian line might mean a break with Tafuri himself, but with the general defeatism of Italian Marxist scholars of the '70s another Machiavellian return to principles should, hopefully, result in a similarly productive theoretical ground as it did for operaismo. And in the professor’s own words: nothing beyond this, from a strict – but sectarian and partial – Marxist point of view.
